## Frontend Implementation

### Files Modified

#### 1. Admin Service (`src/features/admin/adminService.js`)

- Extended initial state with product management fields

**New Async Thunks:**

- `createProduct`: Handles product creation with form validation
- `updateProduct`: Manages product updates with optimistic UI updates
- `deleteProduct`: Removes products and updates state
- `getAllProducts`: Fetches product catalog with filtering

**New Reducers:**

- `clearSelectedProduct`: Clears currently selected product
- `setSelectedProduct`: Sets product for editing
- Complete CRUD operation handling with loading/success/error states

#### 3. Admin Dashboard (`src/Pages/Admin.jsx`)

- `productForm`: Manages form data for create/edit operations
- `showProductModal`: Controls modal visibility
- `productModalMode`: Differentiates between "create" and "edit" modes
- `showDeleteConfirm`: Controls delete confirmation modal
- `productToDelete`: Stores product selected for deletion

##### Event Handlers:

- `handleCreateProduct()`: Opens modal in create mode
- `handleEditProduct(product)`: Opens modal in edit mode with pre-filled data
- `handleDeleteProduct(product)`: Shows delete confirmation
- `confirmDeleteProduct()`: Executes product deletion
- `handleProductSubmit(e)`: Processes form submission for create/update
